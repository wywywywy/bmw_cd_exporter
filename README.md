## Prometheus Config

Add this to prometheus.yml and change the IP/port if needed.

    - job_name: 'bmw_cd_exporter'
        metrics_path: /
        static_configs:
        - targets:
            - '127.0.0.1:9488'

# Notes

It supports multiple vehicles in the same BMW Connected Drive account.

Please make sure the pooling rate to set to maybe once every couple of minutes, to avoid overloading BMW's servers.  Default is 5.

Currently supported metrics are -
1. mileage
2. remaining_range_total
3. remaining_range_electric
4. remaining_range_fuel
5. remaining_fuel
6. charging_level_hv

If there's anything you want to add, let me know by submitting an issue, or just edit the JSON file directly.

The units seem to be in metric rather than imperial no matter where the vehicle is.

This obviously isn't endorsed by BMW, and they don't have a public API.  So they could make breaking changes any time.  Remember to not rely on this exporter for anything critical.

# TODO

1. ~~Docker~~
2. More metrics
